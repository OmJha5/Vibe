sandbox template is nothing but a blueprint jiska use karke sandbox create kiya jaata hai 
Without a template:
    Every time you want to test Next.js, you must install Node, install Next.js, set up shadcn, etc. (boring, slow).

With a template:

    You build a docker image(where you will mention files , paths where script is present and your code)
    Then e2b will create a container and run that script file to check app is running or not , at last it takes the final snapshot and create a e2b template out of it
    Next time, in seconds, you can create a sandbox (a fresh copy) already preloaded with everything → just start coding.

e2b template build is used create sandbox template 
sandbox template is build on top docker image

e2b vs sandbox
    e2b is a tool which gives you ability to create , build , and run sandboxes
    A sandbox is an isolated environment (a container) where your code runs safely.

sandbox is just like docker container there is few differences 
    docker containers lives your in your own system but sandbox container runs on remote cloud 
    Docker containers consume your local CPU/RAM, so you’re limited by your machine. Sandbox containers run in the cloud, so scaling is much easier.
    Docker container → gives you the environment, but you still need to tell it how to start.Sandbox container → built from a template, knows how to start (via the --cmd) and is designed for instant use.

To create a e2b sandbox template you need docker image + a script file(So e2b knows that app is running fine)

one of the features of e2b sandbox is that it gives you live url(deployed) of your website 
why ?? because in their container already everything is preconfigured so that it why deployment is very easy and fast

below is the code to create e2b template for nextjs site which i ran from root directly and from there i specified docker file path 
e2b template build --name vibe-nextjs-test-omkumarjha2 --cmd "/compile_page.sh" --dockerfile ./sandbox-templates/nextjs/e2b.Dockerfile
